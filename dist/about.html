            My name is Kris and I currently live in<a
              href="https://goo.gl/maps/FaRbpDomves"
              >Ann Arbor, Michigan</a
            >with my dog Mable. Currently I work for a health-tech software
            company working to build a platform to help improve the health and
            saftey of children at schools and summer camps. I attended
            <a href="https://www.elmira.edu/#!/"> Elmira College</a>from
            2012-2016 attaining degrees in history and criminal justice. My
            interests lie mainly in the outdoors and I'm an avid hiker, kayaker,
            hunter, and overlander. I also enjoy traveling to new and exciting
            places. Most recently my travels have taken me abroad to Italy where
            I lived for a half-year, Scotland, and Iceland.

          <p>
            I love the outdoors and spend most of my free time in the summer
            months kayaking and camping. I'm also an avid sportsman and enjoy
            hunting both for migratory birds and larger game. If you have
            recommendations on new outdoor places to explore please send them my
            way!

          <h3>World Traveler</h3>
          <p>
            Going new places, meeting new people, and trying new things in
            foreign locations are among some of the opportunities that I enjoy
            the most. The majority of my travels have been in North America and
            Europe, however I hope to expand my horizons to South America and
            Oceania in the coming years.
