            My name is Kris and I currently live in<a
              href="https://goo.gl/maps/FaRbpDomves"
              >Ann Arbor, Michigan</a
            >with my dog Mable. Currently I work for a health-tech software
            company working to fix healthcare in America. I attended<a href="https://www.elmira.edu/#!/" target="_blank"> Elmira 
            College</a>from 2012-2016 attaining degrees in history and 
            criminal justice. My interests lie mainly in the outdoors and I'm 
            an avid hiker, kayaker, hunter, and overlander. I also enjoy 
            traveling to new and exciting places. Most recently my travels have 
            taken me abroad to Italy where I lived for a half-year, Scotland, 
            and Iceland.

          <h3>Software Professional</h3>
          <p>
            Currently I work for<a href="http://artemishealth.com" target="_blank">Artemis Health,</a>
            a data warehouse and analytics company striving to help fix healthcare 
            in America. My day to day activities, among other things, involve ETL 
            and database work. 
            Previously, I was employed by DocNetwork LLC, a software company that 
            produces EMR and registration software for schools and summer camps. My
            role there included everything from translating client needs into
            technical specifications, helping plan and design new features, QAing code
            written by a full team of developers before release, and leading external
            partnerships and API integrations.

          <h3>Outdoorsman</h3>
          <p>
            I love the outdoors and spend most of my free time in the summer
            months kayaking and camping. I'm also an avid sportsman and enjoy
            hunting both for migratory birds and larger game. If you have
            recommendations on new places in the great outdoors to explore 
            please send them my way!

          <h3>World Traveler</h3>
          <p>
            Going new places, meeting new people, and trying new things in
            foreign locations are among some of the opportunities that I enjoy
            the most. The majority of my travels have been in North America and
            Europe, however I hope to expand my horizons to South America and
            Oceania in the coming years.
